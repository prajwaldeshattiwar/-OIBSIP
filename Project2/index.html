        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American business magnate, inventor, and
            investor. He was the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Apple; the chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar;
            a member of The Walt Disney Company's board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar; and the
            founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. He was a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and
            1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.

            Jobs was born in San Francisco to a Syrian father and German-American mother. He was adopted shortly after
            his birth. Jobs attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled
            through India seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in
            1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with
            production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs
            saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user
            interface (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the
            breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the
            desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer to
            feature vector graphics.</p>
